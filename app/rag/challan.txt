How to Contest a Challan Online (India)

If you have received a traffic challan and believe it has been wrongly
issued, you can contest it online through official government portals.
Below is the step-by-step process:

1.  Identify the Issuing Authority
    -   Check whether the challan was issued by the state traffic police
        or Delhi Traffic Police or through the e-Challan Parivahan
        system (https://echallan.parivahan.gov.in).
    -   The challan slip or SMS usually specifies the authority.
2.  Visit the Correct Portal
    -   Parivahan e-Challan Portal: https://echallan.parivahan.gov.in
    -   State-specific portals (e.g., Maharashtra Traffic Police, Delhi
        Traffic Police).
    -   Some states integrate directly with Parivahan.
3.  Log In / Provide Details
    -   Enter challan number, vehicle registration number, or driving
        license number to fetch challan details.
4.  Check Challan Details
    -   Verify the alleged violation, time, place, and
        photographic/video evidence (if available).
5.  Choose the ‘Contest’ or ‘Dispute’ Option
    -   If available, click on “Contest/Dispute” against the challan.
    -   In some states, this will redirect you to the virtual court
        portal (https://vcourts.gov.in).
6.  Submit Representation
    -   Provide a written statement explaining why you believe the
        challan is incorrect (wrong vehicle, wrong location, already
        paid, etc.).
    -   Upload supporting evidence such as:
        -   Vehicle documents
        -   Insurance/PUC copies
        -   Photographs proving your claim
        -   Previous payment receipts
7.  Proceed with Virtual Court (if applicable)
    -   Many states use Virtual Court services to contest challans
        online.
    -   Once redirected, register/login on the virtual court portal.
    -   File your dispute by attaching documents and submitting a
        statement.
8.  Follow Up
    -   Check status regularly on the same portal.
    -   You may receive SMS/email updates regarding your dispute.
    -   If the virtual court requires, you might need to attend an
        online hearing.
9.  Outcome
    -   The court/traffic authority may cancel the challan, reduce the
        fine, or uphold it.
    -   If cancelled, no further payment is needed.
    -   If upheld, payment must be made before the due date.
